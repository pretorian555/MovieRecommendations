# MovieRecommendations
<p>The script [Spark-job-MovieRec25ml-EMR.py](https://github.com/pretorian555/MovieRecommendations/blob/main/Spark-job-MovieRec25ml-EMR.py) calculates most similar movies for each movie in the list based on the movie ratings by different users. <br>
The movie ratings dataset was produced by GroupLens - a research lab in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. The dataset contains 25 million movie ratings of 62k movies. The ratings range from 1 to 5 stars. <p>
<p>The final output is used in a demo movie recommender website where each recommendation is based on how similar the movies are to the selected movie. <p>
